          Unfortunately, great designs cant always be made public. Working with companies and clients can be challenging
          as your designs cant be shared. If you would like to see some of the work I can share with others email me at:
          <br />
          <br /> petros.chantz [at] gmail [dot] com <br />
          <br />
          and youâ€™ll receive a private portfolio.
